# Puckman Ball Reloaded

The original Puckman Ball, written in Java for HackRPI 2024, is **[here](https://github.com/dwskcw/PuckmanBall).**

This is an attempt to rewrite the original project in C++ to add new features and potentially a web port.

By using the [Raylib-Quickstart](https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart) template, you are able to build the project in VSCode using ```Ctrl-Shift-B``` or ```F5```.
